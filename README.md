# Optimal Location Query (OLQ) Visualization

This repository is a fork of [OLQ-Visualization-Legacy](https://github.com/fdonascimento/OLQ-Visualization-Legacy).

All the details of how the project was built can be found at [OLQ-Visualization-Legacy README](https://github.com/fdonascimento/OLQ-Visualization-Legacy).

The legacy project was built using:
- Java 8
- Spring Boot 2
- Angular 6
- Node 8

The goal of this new project is to modernize the legacy app by using the latest versions of the tech stack above, as well as enhance the application by applying the current best practices for design, resilience, performance, security, and scalability. This repo should serve as a showcase for the technologies and practices that I'm specialized or skills that I'm developing.
